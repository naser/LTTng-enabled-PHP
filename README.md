LTTng PHP tracing extension

## Installation

You can build and install the LTTng extension from source which is straightforward:

      git clone https://github.com/naser/LTTng-php-tracing-module.git
      cd LTTng-php-tracing-module
      phpize
      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install


Currently it only supports PHP 7.x, but the support for the other versions will be added shortly.
